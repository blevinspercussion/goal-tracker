          <p>
            This app will help you to keep track of your personal goals. Use the
            tabs above to navigate between your short term and long term goals,
            as well as your daily practice routine. While using the 'daily
            practice' tab, you can select the day of the week at the side of the
            screen. Be sure to mark off each goal as in is completed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can also mark off your short term and long term goals as you
            complete them, under their respective tabs. Remember that short term
            goals are achievement that should take weeks or maybe even months to
            complete, and they should be supported by your daily practice. Each
            one of your practice goals should help you work toward complete your
            short term goals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Long term goals are achievements that can take months or maybe even
            years to complete, and are huge accomplishments that mark a turning
            point in your journey...a 'levelling up' so to speak. These goals
            should be celebrated as major milestones!
